**This repository serves 4 purposes:**
1. 📝 My personal training documentation
2. 🗺️ A beginner roadmap for anyone entering DevOps
3. 📎 A place to attach resources, scripts, and notes
4. 💼 A portfolio project showing real practical exposure

## 🧭 How Beginners Should Use This Repo

**If you are new to DevOps, follow this exact order:**

**Step 1 →** Start with [Week 01 - Linux](./Week-01-Linux-Fundamentals/notes.md)
> Linux is the foundation of everything in DevOps. Don't skip it.

**Step 2 →** Move to [Week 02 - Networking](./Week-02-Networking/notes.md)
> Understanding how computers talk to each other is critical for cloud and DevOps work.

**Step 3 →** Read [Week 03 - Internet & Servers](./Week-03-Internet-and-Server-Setup/notes.md)
> Learn how the internet works and how servers are set up with shell scripts.

**Step 4 →** Go through [Week 04 - Advanced Linux](./Week-04-Advanced-Linux/notes.md)
> Cron jobs, permissions, and system tools used in real DevOps work.

**Step 5 →** Study [Week 05 - Git](./Week-05-Git-Version-Control/notes.md)

## 💡 Things I Learned the Hard Way

> ⚠️ These are hard lessons — save yourself the pain!

- Always test your SSH keys **before** adding them to Jenkins credentials
- Docker containers are **not** VMs — they share the host kernel
- `git rebase` rewrites history — never rebase a shared/public branch
- Port conflicts in Docker are easy to miss — always check with `docker ps`
- Cron job timing syntax has **5 fields** — count them every time
- A misconfigured security group in AWS will silently block all traffic
- `EXPOSE` in Dockerfile is documentation only — use `-p` to actually publish
